                    WHAT IS CYCLEFE?
                </h1>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Cyclefé is an upcoming caffeteria where everyone is welcome. The idea behind is to create a platform
                    for international students to hang out, meet new people or simply to have a cup of good coffee or
                    tea for affordable prices. <br>
                    The concept of Cyclefé was created by group of young people from Aalborg, who can also relate to the
                    problems of international students, such as low budget, socializing with strangers or lack of
                    original places to hang out. <br>
                    Wanna meet someone new, enjoy nice atmosphere or simply not spent a fortune for an evening? Cyclefé
                    might be your cup of tea!
